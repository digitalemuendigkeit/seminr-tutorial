# The structural model:

* relationships between latent variables
* order and sequence of constructs: theory/ experiences and knowledge

???

The structural model describes the relationships between latent variables. 
(Thus, it justifies the constructs and the path-relationships within the structural model.)
The order and sequence of constructs is based in either a theory or the experiences and knowledge of a researcher.

# The structural model 2 - exogeneous vs. endogeneous variables:

* variables: can be dependent and independent
* latent variables = independent = exogeneous latent variables (Y1 and Y2)
* latent variables = dependent (Y4) or independent and dependent (Y3) = endogeneous latent variables (Y3)
* Variables with only arrows coming from it = exogeneous latent variables
* endogeneous latent variables: incoming and outgoing arrows (Y3) or only incoming arrows (Y4) 
* exogeneous latent variables: no error terms 

???

Variables can also serve simultaneously as independent and dependent variables.
Latent variables, that only serve as independent variables are called exogeneous latent variables (here Y1 and Y2).
Latent variables, that only serve as dependent variable (such as Y4) or as independent AND dependent variable (such as Y3) are called endogeneous latent variables.
Variables in the structural model with only arrows coming from it, are exogeneous latent variables.
In contrast, endogeneous variables can have incoming and outgoing arrows (Y3) or only incoming arrows (Y4).
Exogeneous latent variables have no error terms, because these constructs depict the independent variables explaining the dependent variables in the path-model.

# Specification of structural model:
* Developing a structural model:
 1. sequence of the constructs
 2. relationships between constructs
 * represent hypotheses and theory (to be tested) 
 
???

To develop a structural model, two things must be considered: The sequence of the constructs and the relationships between the constructs.
Both aspects are important and must be reflected when developing a structural model, because they represent the hypotheses and thus the theory to be tested.

## Sequence of constructs:
* based on theory/ concept, logic/ experiences
* path-models from left to right
 * left: independent variables
 * right: dependent variables
 * left: influence variables on the right

![](Figures/Path-model.png)

???

The sequence of constructs in a structural model is based on a theory or concept, on logic or experiences of a researcher. 
Developed path-models are set up from left to right. 
The variables on the left side are the independent (exploratory) variables, the variables on the right are the dependent variables (outcomes).
Thus, the variables on the left are sequential ahead of the variables on the right and influence the variables on the right.

## Determining sequence of constructs:
* hard: contradictory theoretic perspectives imply different sequences 
 * Example: reputation > satisfaction > loyalty
* should always be based on theory and logic
* contradictory perpectives: personal judgement 
* possible: competing models

???

To determine the sequence of constructs is hard, because contradictory theoretic perspectives can imply different sequences of the latent variables.
For example, customer satisfaction can determine the reputation of a company, but the reputation of a company could also determine satisfaction.
The sequence of constructs (in a conceptual model) should always be based on theory and logic. 
If in literature there is no clearly defined sequence of constructs, a researcher must decide which sequence he/she wants to consider. 
For complex models, researchers may need to adjust the construct sequence multiple times to adequately capture the theoretical relationships. 
There may also be competing models with different sequences of constructs.

## Relationships between constructs:
* specified by arrows
* directed relations = causal
* conflict: completeness (all relations supported by theory) and sparsity (few relations)
* sparsity: not everything should explain everything
* mostly, linear relationships between two or more constructs within one path-model
* more complex modell relationships: mediations; moderations (next slides)

???

After specifying the sequence of constructs, the researcher determines the relationships between the constructs using arrows. 
Generally the tip points to the right, which again shows that the constructs on the left predict the constructs on the right. 
Sometimes, the directed relations are called causal, when these are supported by the theory. 
When drawing the arrows, the researcher must weigh on the one hand side between theoretical completeness, what means that all relationships supported by the theory are integrated in the model and on the other hand economical modeling, meaning the use of only few relations. 
In most cases, researcher analyze linear relationships between two or more constructs within a path model. 
Eventually, the theory refers to more complex model relationships as well as to mediation and moderation, what we talk about in a later video.
