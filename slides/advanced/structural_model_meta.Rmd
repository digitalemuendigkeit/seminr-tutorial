# The structural model:

## Mediation:
- mediating effect: third construct occurs between two other related constructs
- e.g. model with direct and indirect effects:
- direct effects: two constructs are related by only one arrow
- indirect effects: related by a sequence of relationships with at least one mediating construct
- indirect effects: sequence of two or more direct (indicated by arrows) effects = mediating effect

## Mediation:
- most common used for "explanation" why a relation between an exogeneous and an ednogeneous construct exists
- (e.g. one observes a relation between two constructs, but is unsure "why" this relation exist or if the relation is the only possible relation between the constructs)
