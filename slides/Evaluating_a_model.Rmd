# Evaluating a model:
Following, we present how the quality of a structural-equation model should be evaluated.

# Overview:

- primary quality or evaluation criteria and their systematic application to PLS-path-models 
- evaluation of reflective specified measurement models: application of relevant evaluation criteria and their appropriate evaluation
-

# Evaluation of measurement models

- estimation of model > empirical measured variables to assess the relationship between the indicators and constructs (measurement models) and between the different constructs (structural model)
